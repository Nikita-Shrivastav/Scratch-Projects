# Scratch-Projects
When I was going to into 9th grade, I taught kids ranging from ten years old to twelve years old how to code on Scratch. The attached files are the code that I wrote to create the games that I used as an example for the kids. 
From scratch, I downloaded the files which were originally saved as an sb3 file. I then renamed it to a zip file which allows me to open it with any zip utility. I taught the kids for a company called, "Finding Stregnths". 
I taught them about the basic functions in Scratch and what the different categories meant. I also helped them understood how to use the costumes tab and personalize their sprite.
