# Scratch-Projects
When I was going to into 9th grade, I taught kids ranging from ten years old to twelve years old how to code on Scratch. The attached files are the code that I wrote to create the games that I used as an example for the kids. 
From scratch, I downloaded the files which were originally saved as an sb3 file. I then renamed it to a zip file which allows me to read it with any zip utility. To open the files, download the files and they will get saved as .sb3 files. if you would like to read the files, rename the files as a .zip file which will allow you to open the files with any zip extender. I taught the kids for a company called, "Finding Stregnths". 
I taught them about the basic functions in Scratch and what the different categories meant. I also helped them understood how to use the costumes tab and personalize their sprite.
